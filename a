                <p>I'm Kanjanaroj Khamkhom,Computer Engineering (Year 4) Passionate about technology and innovation</p>

                <p>I am currently a 4th year undergraduate student in Computer Engineering. With my interest in technology since I was a child, I started by disassembling and assembling computers
                    by myself, and was encouraged by my family to continuously study and experiment with new things.
                    This passion led me to study Computer Engineering to develop knowledge and skills that can be
                    applied to future technologies.</p>

                    <p>Participating in university activities : the first step to real learning</p>

                    <p>I have a motto for my university life and I have participated in both formal and informal
                        activities. These activities are equally important because they help me develop a variety of
                        skills. They are also an opportunity to network, build relationships with seniors and juniors,
                        and learn how to adapt to a wider society.</p>

                    <p>Participating in university activities is not just about having fun, but also about
                        understanding ourselves and others better, and preparing us to cope with the future world of
                        work and society.</p>
