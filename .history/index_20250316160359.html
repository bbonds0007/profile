                <p>I'm Kanjanaroj Khamkhom,Computer Engineering (Year 4) Passionate about technology and innovation</p>

                <p>I am currently a 4th year undergraduate student in Computer Engineering. With my interest in
                    technology since I was a child, I started by disassembling and assembling computers
                    by myself, and was encouraged by my family to continuously study and experiment with new things.
                    This passion led me to study Computer Engineering to develop knowledge and skills that can be
                    applied to future technologies.</p>

                    <p>Whether my work comes from classroom projects or self-study, it is important for my future
                        academic and career path. Studying computer engineering has no fixed boundaries because
                        technology is constantly changing. Starting a project now is preparing me to adapt and develop

                        adapt, solve problems, and grow alongside the rapid changes in the digital world. By constantly
                        improving my skills and experimenting with new technologies, I can ensure that I am ready for
                        any future challenge. I can ensure that I am ready for any challenge the future holds. My

                    <p>Participating in university activities : the first step to real learning</p>

                    <p>I have a motto for my university life and I have participated in both formal and informal
                        activities. These activities are equally important because they help me develop a variety of
                        skills. They are also an opportunity to network, build relationships with seniors and juniors,
                        and learn how to adapt to a wider society.</p>

                    <p>Participating in university activities is not just about having fun, but also about understanding
                        ourselves and others better, and preparing us to cope with the future world of work and society.
                        These experiences shape our growth and equip us with the confidence needed to face future
                        challenges.</p>
